# Hi there, I'm Prasenjeet Symon! üëã

## About Me

During my first year, I began developing my childhood dream project named **Sculify**, a school management platform. It was a SaaS software designed for both small and large schools. Similar to Shopify, but tailored for schools, I served as the CTO and Founder alongside five team members. My responsibilities extended beyond the technical aspects to include marketing and direct sales, coordinating with over 100 field agents of Sculify. Ultimately, I sold Sculify and chose to freelance for several years to broaden my experience across various projects and technologies.
